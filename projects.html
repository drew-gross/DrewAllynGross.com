      <h3><a href="http://www.upphoto.ca">UpPhoto</a></h3>
      <p>
	UpPhoto is a fast photo uploader for Facebook that works similarly to Dropbox. It was developed by Akash, Christophe, Carlo, and me as en entry in the Facebook Hackathon. UpPhoto won the constest, against 50 other teams, and will let us go to the inter-university competition at Facebook Headquarters in November.

      <h3><a href="http://debatewithme.com/">DebateWithMe</a></h3>
      <p>
	DebateWithMe is a work-in-progress website that I created to learn ruby on rails. The purpose of the site is to give people a new way to have debates with each other, and the reason I created the site is to explore a different method of having tree style comments, different from what Hacker News and Reddit do. Source code is available <a href="https://github.com/drew-gross/DebateWithMe">on GitHub</a>.

      <h3>Cave Story Mods</h3>
      <p>I've worked on a number of different mods for cave story, such as <a href="http://www.cavestory.org/forums/showthread.php?t=2334">a couple mini-mods</a>, <a href="http://www.cavestory.org/forums/showthread.php?t=1425">Hell's Legion (dead link)</a>, <a href="http://www.cavestory.org/forums/showthread.php?t=3136"> Achron</a>, and the <a href="http://www.cavestory.org/forums/showthread.php?t=2706">Weapon Hax</a>. All of the mods involved reverse engineering cave story and editing the assembly directly.
